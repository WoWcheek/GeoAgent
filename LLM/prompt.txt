Analyze the following Google Street View image and make your best possible estimate of where it was taken.

First, briefly describe important visual details, such as:

Natural environment (landscape, vegetation, climate hints)

Architecture and building styles

Language or writing on signs

Road markings, traffic signs, vehicle types, and license plates

Cultural symbols (flags, religious signs, local businesses)

Based on these observations, reason through possible locations. List 2â€“4 likely regions, countries, or cities.

Then, select the single most likely location and explain your choice clearly, linking specific visual details to your conclusion. If full certainty is not possible, make an educated guess based on the strongest evidence.

Finally, on a new line by itself, write the predicted Latitude and Longitude in the exact format:
Lat: XX.XXXX, Lng: XX.XXXX

Only provide valid float values with exactly four decimal places.
