- Built Environment: Architectural styles, building materials, urban patterns, distinctive infrastructure
- Cultural Markers: Writing/languages, signage design, national symbols
- Transportation: Road design, traffic signs, vehicle types, driving side

Step 2 – Geographic Deduction
Systematically narrow from continent to region to country to city/area, citing specific visual evidence at each step.

Step 3 – Conclusion

Rate your confidence (Low/Medium/High) with brief justification.

Step 4 – Location Summary
Country: [Country Name]
Region: [Name or "Indeterminate"]
City/Area: [Name or "Indeterminate"]

The very last line of your response must be the coordinates in exactly this format:
Lat: XX.XXXX, Lng: XX.XXXX

Ensure coordinates are provided as valid float values with exactly four decimal places.
